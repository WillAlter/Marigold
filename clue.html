            <h1>Combine your ability scores to reach the answer</h1>
            <p>Marigold recalled words of wisdom from her mother, back when she gave her that lock. She had reminded her that in times of need, she should combine her strengths and weaknesses to pave the path forward. She had said:</p>

            <p>1. When the way is blocked, take a deep breath and tense your muscles. With your grit and your physique, you can clear any obstacle.</p>
            <p>2. Make sure to sometimes look behind you and notice what you have been neglecting. Your sageness and people skills may not have served you well, but they may yet come in handy.</p>
            <p>3. And finally, be proud of your greatest talents, they will carry you far, whether it be into the depths of magicks or nature.</p>
